# VehicleTracker
VehicleTracker
## Explanation
- The program assumes the .dat file is present at the root of the project
- The vehicle positions can be sorted. To keep things simple I used the default sort provided by Lists. This comes at a cost of about 1 second on my computer. I doubt if this
  is the best sort Algorithm
- Having sorted the Coordinates we can use search algorithms like Binary Search to look the closest vehicle position.
